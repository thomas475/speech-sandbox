# Speech AI Sandbox

This repository contains implementations of machine learning architectures for audio generation, with experiments performed on the Speech Commands dataset.

The model currently examined is the LSTM-Autoencoder.

All models are implemented using **PyTorch**.

## Installation

To set up the environment, create a Conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate speech-sandbox
```

## Showcase

Listen to the generated audio samples [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thomas475/speech-sandbox/blob/main/showcase.html).
